## Workload

_Workload: List Queries_
1. _Registration_ – write – The data from the registration form is sent to the server and checked for the correctness of the written data.
2. _Authorization_ – read – Encrypted data from the server is checked against the user's entered data. If the data is correct, then login to the user's personal account is performed.
3. _Follow_ – write – The ability to search, and follow users and send data to the database.
4. _View the list of following users_ – read – The user will receive a list of following users from the database and go to their pages.
5. _Loading the news feed (uploading photos and videos)_ – read – following users' posts will be visible in the news feed.
6. _Ability to see likes and comments_ – read – The user will be able to receive information about likes and comments from the database
7. _The ability to add to favorites, comment_ – write – The ability for the user to like and leave comments.

_Workload: quantify/qualify the queries_
1. _Registration_. Since this is a training project, we do not expect a large influx of users. 20 requests per day will be enough to test the registration. 20 writes/day. Since the request is sent to the database, the operation should not take more than 1 second.
2. _Authorization_. The situation with authorization is similar. 20 records per day will be enough for testing. Since a get request is used, the operation should not take longer than 1 second.
3. _Follow_. It is expected from 1 to 50 post requests per day. Since this is a post request with a filter, the operation should not take longer than 1 second. Then the following user is sent to the database, which also should not last longer than 1 second.
4. _View the list of following users_. No more than 20 requests per day. There is a get requests for all the data, but since we will have no more than a hundred following users, the request and the render should be no more than 3 seconds.
5. _Loading the news feed_. No more than 2 requests per day. Since it will be necessary to upload not only text, but also photos, rendering can take up to 3 seconds per post.
6._ Ability to see likes and comments_. Approximately 20 requests per day will be enough for testing. Since this is a get request, the operation should take no longer than 1 second.
7. _The ability to add to favorites, comment_. As usual, 20 requests will be enough. Since this is an addition to the database, the operation should take no longer than 1 second.
